# My Philosophy on Tolkien's Work

This is where your philosophical thoughts about Tolkien will go. You can write in Markdown format and it will be beautifully rendered.

## The Power of Myth and Story

Tolkien believed that stories, particularly fairy-stories, serve a fundamental human need. They provide:

-   **Escape** - Not as cowardice, but as the courage to see beyond our immediate circumstances
-   **Recovery** - The ability to see familiar things with fresh eyes
-   **Consolation** - The promise that even in the darkest times, hope endures

## Sub-creation and the Secondary World

Tolkien's concept of "sub-creation" suggests that when we create stories, we participate in the divine act of creation itself. The Secondary World must have:

-   Internal consistency
-   Believable rules and logic
-   Emotional truth, even if not literal truth

## The Eucatastrophe

The "eucatastrophe" - the sudden joyous turn, the glimpse of grace - is at the heart of all great fairy-stories. It's the moment when:

> "...we get a piercing glimpse of joy, and heart's desire, that for a moment passes outside the frame, rends indeed the very web of story, and lets a gleam come through."

## Applicability vs. Allegory

Tolkien famously stated: "I cordially dislike allegory in all its manifestations." Instead, he preferred **applicability** - where readers can find their own meanings and connections without being constrained by the author's specific intentions.
