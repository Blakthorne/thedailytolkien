# Like/Dislike Functionality Testing Guide

## Verification Steps

### 1. Sign in as a user

-   Go to http://localhost:3000
-   If not signed in, click "Sign in" and use one of these test accounts:
    -   Email: `commentor@example.com`
    -   Password: `password123`

### 2. Test Like/Dislike Functionality

Once signed in on the home page, you should see:

#### Like Button:

-   ✅ Button should be clickable with thumbs up icon and count
-   ✅ Clicking should toggle the active state (button becomes highlighted)
-   ✅ Count should update immediately
-   ✅ Button should have `aria-pressed` attribute for accessibility

#### Dislike Button:

-   ✅ Button should be clickable with thumbs down icon and count
-   ✅ Clicking should toggle the active state (button becomes highlighted)
-   ✅ Count should update immediately
-   ✅ Clicking dislike when like is active should switch states

#### Edge Cases:

-   ✅ Clicking the same button twice should remove the like/dislike
-   ✅ Buttons should be disabled during AJAX requests to prevent double-clicks
-   ✅ Page reload should preserve your like/dislike state

### 3. Test Unauthenticated Experience

-   Sign out or open an incognito window
-   Go to http://localhost:3000
-   You should see:
    -   ✅ Non-interactive like/dislike buttons showing counts
    -   ✅ "Sign in to like/dislike" message

## Technical Details Fixed

### Frontend Issues Resolved:

1. **Event Delegation**: Fixed event delegation to properly capture clicks on button elements and their children (SVG icons, spans)
2. **CSRF Protection**: Added proper CSRF token validation and error handling
3. **Button States**: Implemented proper loading states and disabled buttons during requests
4. **Error Handling**: Improved error handling with user-friendly messages
5. **Double-click Prevention**: Buttons are disabled during AJAX requests

### Backend Verification:

-   ✅ All API endpoints working correctly (`/quotes/:id/likes`)
-   ✅ JSON responses are properly formatted
-   ✅ Authentication and authorization working
-   ✅ Database operations (create, update, delete likes) functioning
-   ✅ ActionCable broadcasts for real-time updates working

### Code Quality Improvements:

-   ✅ Added comprehensive JSDoc documentation
-   ✅ Improved error handling and user feedback
-   ✅ Optimized JavaScript for better performance
-   ✅ Enhanced accessibility with proper ARIA attributes
-   ✅ Clean, readable code structure

## If Issues Persist

If you still experience issues:

1. **Check Browser Console**: Open DevTools (F12) and look for JavaScript errors
2. **Check Network Tab**: Verify AJAX requests are being sent to `/quotes/:id/likes`
3. **Verify User Authentication**: Make sure you're signed in as a valid user
4. **Clear Browser Cache**: Sometimes cached JavaScript can cause issues

The functionality has been thoroughly tested and all backend integration tests are passing.
