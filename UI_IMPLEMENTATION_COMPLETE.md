## ðŸ”§ Technical Improvements

### Controller Enhancements

```ruby
# QuotesController improvements
before_action :set_quote, only: [ :index ]

def index
  # Comprehensive data loading for optimal performance
  @user_like_status = current_user&.quote_likes&.find_by(quote: @quote)&.like_type
  @likes_count = @quote.quote_likes.where(like_type: "like").count
  @dislikes_count = @quote.quote_likes.where(like_type: "dislike").count
  @comments_count = @quote.comments.count
  @comments = @quote.comments.includes(:user, :replies).where(parent_id: nil).order(created_at: :asc)
  @tags = @quote.tags
end

private

def set_quote
  @quote = Quote.includes(:quote_likes, :comments, :tags)
    .where(id: params[:id] || Quote.daily_quote&.id)
    .first || Quote.daily_quote
end
```

### UI Component Structure

```erb
<!-- Engagement Controls -->
<div class="engagement-controls">
