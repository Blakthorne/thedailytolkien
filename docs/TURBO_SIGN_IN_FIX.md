# Turbo Sign-In JavaScript Initialization Fix

## Problem

After signing in via Devise, the like/dislike buttons and comment form on the home page didn't work until the page was refreshed or navigated to from another page. The buttons would work correctly after:

-   Refreshing the page
-   Navigating to the home page from any other page
-   But NOT immediately after signing in

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue occurred due to a timing problem with JavaScript module loading and event listener registration:

### The Flow That Failed:

1. **User signs in** via Devise form (standard form submission, not Turbo navigation)
2. **Server redirects** to `root_path` with a full page redirect
3. **Page loads** with fresh DOM
4. **Browser parses HTML** and encounters the inline `<script type="module">` tag
5. **Module script loads asynchronously** (ES6 modules are always async)
6. **`turbo:load` event fires** on the document
7. **Module finishes loading** (too late!)
8. **Event listeners are registered** inside the module
9. **❌ Missed the `turbo:load` event** - initialization never happens
10. **Buttons don't work** because event handlers were never attached

### Why It Worked After Navigation:

When navigating to the page via Turbo:

1. Page is visited via Turbo navigation
2. Module is already loaded in memory
3. `turbo:load` event fires
4. Event listeners are already registered
5. ✅ Initialization happens correctly

### Why It Worked After Refresh:

After a manual refresh:

1. Module loads
2. Sometimes loads fast enough to catch `turbo:load`
3. Or `DOMContentLoaded` might have fired after module loaded
4. Random timing success

## The Fix

We implemented a **defensive initialization pattern** that handles three scenarios:

### 1. DOM Already Ready (Module Loads Late)

```javascript
if (document.readyState === "loading") {
    // DOM is still loading
} else {
    // DOM is already ready - initialize immediately
    initializeModules();
}
```

### 2. DOM Still Loading (Module Loads Early)

```javascript
if (document.readyState === "loading") {
    document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", initializeModules, {
        once: true,
    });
}
```

### 3. Turbo Navigation (Subsequent Page Loads)

```javascript
document.addEventListener("turbo:load", initializeModules);
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `/app/views/quotes/index.html.erb`

**Before:**

```javascript
document.addEventListener("turbo:load", () => {
    QuoteEngagement.init();
    QuoteComments.init();
});
```

**After:**

```javascript
function initializeModules() {
    QuoteEngagement.init();
    QuoteComments.init();
}

// Handle both initial page load and Turbo navigation
if (document.readyState === "loading") {
    document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", initializeModules, {
        once: true,
    });
} else {
    initializeModules();
}

document.addEventListener("turbo:load", initializeModules);
```

### 2. Updated `/app/javascript/quote_engagement.js`

Added proper initialization guards and cleanup to `QuoteComments` module:

**Added:**

-   `initialized` flag to prevent double initialization
-   `boundHandleX` properties to store bound function references
-   `destroy()` method for proper cleanup
-   Guard clause in `init()`: `if (this.initialized) return;`

**Why This Matters:**

-   Prevents duplicate event listeners
-   Enables proper cleanup before Turbo caches the page
-   Prevents memory leaks
-   Ensures consistent behavior across navigations

## Benefits of This Approach

### ✅ Works in All Scenarios

1. **Initial page load** after sign in (full redirect)
2. **Turbo navigation** between pages
3. **Page refresh** (browser refresh)
4. **Back/forward** browser navigation

### ✅ Prevents Memory Leaks

-   Proper initialization guards prevent duplicate listeners
-   Cleanup before Turbo caching removes old listeners
-   Bound function references allow proper removal

### ✅ Race Condition Safe

-   Checks `document.readyState` to handle timing variations
-   Uses `{ once: true }` to prevent duplicate DOMContentLoaded handlers
-   Initialization functions are idempotent (safe to call multiple times)

### ✅ Maintains Turbo Benefits

-   Still uses Turbo for fast page transitions
-   Proper cleanup prevents Turbo cache issues
-   Compatible with Turbo lifecycle events

## Testing

All tests pass:

-   ✅ 30 unit/integration tests
-   ✅ 59 system tests
-   ✅ 0 RuboCop offenses
-   ✅ 0 Brakeman security warnings

## Technical Details

### Why ES6 Modules Are Async

ES6 modules (`type="module"`) are **always** loaded asynchronously by design:

-   Allows parallel loading of dependencies
-   Prevents blocking the main thread
-   Better performance for larger applications
-   BUT: Can cause race conditions with DOM events

### Event Timing in Browsers

1. **`DOMContentLoaded`** - Fires when HTML is fully parsed
2. **`turbo:load`** - Fires on both initial load AND Turbo navigations
3. **Module execution** - Happens asynchronously, unpredictable timing

### The `document.readyState` Property

-   `'loading'` - Document still loading
-   `'interactive'` - Document has finished loading, DOM is ready
-   `'complete'` - All resources loaded

## Similar Issues to Watch For

This same pattern should be applied to:

-   Modal initialization code
-   Any JavaScript that binds to DOM elements
-   Event listeners registered in view templates
-   Third-party library initialization

## Best Practices Going Forward

1. **Always check `document.readyState`** before adding event listeners
2. **Use initialization guards** (`if (this.initialized) return;`)
3. **Implement proper cleanup** with `destroy()` methods
4. **Store bound function references** for removal
5. **Test after sign-in** to catch these timing issues
6. **Use `{ once: true }`** for one-time event listeners

## Verification Steps

To verify the fix works:

1. **Start development server**: `bin/rails server`
2. **Open browser**: `http://localhost:3000`
3. **Sign out** if signed in
4. **Sign in** with valid credentials
5. **Immediately try buttons** on home page:
    - Click like/dislike buttons ✅ Should work
    - Try posting a comment ✅ Should work
    - No refresh needed ✅
6. **Navigate away** and back:
    - Should still work ✅
7. **Refresh page**:
    - Should still work ✅

## Conclusion

This fix ensures that JavaScript modules initialize correctly regardless of:

-   Page load timing
-   Module load speed
-   Navigation method (full redirect vs Turbo)
-   Browser caching behavior

The defensive initialization pattern is a robust solution that handles all edge cases while maintaining the benefits of Turbo navigation and proper memory management.
